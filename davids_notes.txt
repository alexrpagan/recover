david's notes of stuff to do:

1)

	when recovering, update owners for segments at backups to recovery master
	may require some intermediate state or knowledge of recovery
	possibly do it in PullSegments, possible when view changes
	
2)

	uniquely identify segments across servers
	
3)

	replay and append in PBServer.ElectRecoveryMaster
	
4)

	viewserver should remember ongoing recoveries and be able to timeout or recognized failed recovery master
